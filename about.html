        <p class="text-about">Straight from the wild east Berlin savannah,
             Power Apes is a 4-piece band that brings back loudly the dirty 
             sounds of 60’s Garage and the high energy Rock & Roll from the
            early 70’s. Their primitive groove and bouncing riffs create a
            solid base for the raw vocals to deliver crazy tales about the
             wild life in the modern world. Originally from South America 
             and Europe, those 4 urban apes jumped in many international 
             stages with bands such as Messer Chups, Mammooth Mammoth, 
             Love Toys and Murder Songs.</p>
            <p class="text-about">releasing their debut album “Power Apes” in 2020 - 
            recorded & mixed by the drummer himself at his 
            “Condor Studio Recordings”, and mastered by Nene Baratto at 
            “Big Snuff Studio” - the band came out with a new single called 
            “I Don't Know How To Use It”, from the upcoming album 
            “The Apes Are Out Of The Cage”.
            While the world was suffering a global epidemic that locked 
            everyone home, the Power Apes decided to get out of the cage 
            releasing a live studio session at their own studio, featuring 
            songs from the debut album. While currently still looking for a 
            label, the band is getting ready to climb on a stage for the first 
            in early 2021.</p>
